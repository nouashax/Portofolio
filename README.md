# Portofolio
Made by **Ray Christofer**

This is the page for my portofolio.
For now I just do one project.
There will be more in the future ~~I really hope so~~

The First project is **Top Games on Google Play Store**
You can download the dataset in [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruvildave/top-play-store-games/code)
This is the simple dataset of top games performers in **Google Play store**
The Goal is just really to do some Exploratory Data Analysis and getting some insight on the dataset

There are some insight that we can find here.
You may read it better on the python file
I hope you and I can learn something from this project

Thank You
